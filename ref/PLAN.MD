## 1. Problem Statement

*Initial Draft:* Tutors, especially those managing multiple students, spend a significant amount of administrative time on repetitive tasks. This includes tracking student progress, managing a library of assignments, assigning personalized homework, and communicating with students and parents. This administrative overhead reduces the time available for high-value activities like lesson planning and direct instruction.

***Your Feedback Needed:***
*   *What are the biggest pain points this description is missing?*
*   *Which administrative tasks are the most critical to solve first?*
